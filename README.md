# Python
Prokaryotic ORF finder

This repository contains a Python script that searches for Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in a bacterial DNA sequence. ORFs are regions of DNA that potentially encode proteins.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bacteria-orf-search.git
   ```

3. Change into the cloned directory:

   ```
   cd bacteria-orf-search
   ```

4. Run the script:

   ```
   python orf_search.py
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the DNA sequence you want to analyze. The script will identify and display any coding regions (ORFs) found in the sequence.

6. To exit the script, enter `0`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
